									<h3><a >Making a training set</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The two steps for building this project are creating a training set and building the machine learning program.
									This process works best if the team can manually label data for supervised learning.
									If manual labeling is not feasible, we follow an alternative approach.
									We sample random lines of data, selecting about 5-10% depending on the dataset's size.
									Next, we use a medical dictionary and abbreviations to match terms to known subcategories.
									These matches form the foundation for constructing the training set.

									<h3><a >Training the data</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The pipeline for machine learning includes TF-IDF and Count Vectorizer.
									TF-IDF is used to weigh terms by their importance, reducing the influence of commonly occurring but less meaningful words.
									Count Vectorizer captures the raw frequency of terms, ensuring that high-occurrence patterns are well-represented.
									Together, they complement each other by balancing term relevance with term frequency, making them effective for text data in this instance.
									Multinomial Naive Bayes is used because it performs well with text data, particularly when feature values represent counts or probabilities.

									<h3><a >Validation</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									K-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of a model by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, ensuring that every data point is used for both training and testing.
									Mean accuracy is used to summarize the average performance of the model across all folds, providing a reliable measure of its predictive power.
									High values for accuracy score indicates strong model performance.
									A K-fold accuracy in the mid-80s to 90s demonstrates consistent predictions across subsets, showing the model generalizes well.
									A mean accuracy score of 86% confirms the model's overall effectiveness in capturing patterns and making accurate predictions, while avoiding overfitting.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									Cross-Validation Accuracy Scores for each fold: [0.87732342 0.82527881 0.81412639 0.91449814 0.88059701]
									Mean Accuracy Score: 0.86
