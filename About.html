								<h3>Early Life and School</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, I developed a passion for technology and problem-solving early on. 
								I graduated with distinction in Electrical Engineering (Computer Engineering minor), earning a 3.5/4.0 cGPA. During my studies, I explored 
								fascinating courses like Databases and Neuro-Fuzzy & Soft Computing, a machine learning course that introduced me 
								to the power of data science. These courses not only provided me with foundational technical skills but also sparked a 
								deep interest in applying technology to solve real-world problems. For my final project in machine learning, I combined 
								computer vision and convolutional neural networks to create a weather-registration system that helped users prepare their
								 clothing for the day based on predicted conditions.

									<h3>Work Experience</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have worked in the software industry, including roles in the oil and gas and tech sectors, 
									where I honed my skills in software development. While these positions provided valuable experience, 
									I wanted to move beyond these roles and explore opportunities that aligned more closely with 
									my interests and goals. This shift led me on a journey of completing a masters degree in International Relations and Policy.
								</p>

									<h3>Plans for the Future</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I work at the intersection of data analysis, policy, and investment, using tools like Excel and Python to identify trends, assess risk, and support evidence-based decision-making.
									Going forward, I plan to use my website to share concise syntheses of books, research, and applied data analysis focused on policy and investment-relevant questions.
									Driven by continuous learning, I enjoy tackling complex problems and translating analysis into insights that inform real-world decisions and impact.
